## Challenge Overview

### Day 1: Second Largest Element  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/second-largest3735)

An easy but tricky problem solved through a straightforward approach.  
**Problem:** Find the second largest element in an array.  
**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Declare** two variables: `largest` and `secondLargest`.  
2. **Iterate** over the array.  
3. If an element greater than `largest` occurs:  
   - **Update:** Set `secondLargest` to the current value of `largest`.  
   - **Assign:** Update `largest` with the new element.  
4. Else if the element is greater than `secondLargest` but smaller than `largest`:  
   - **Update:** Set `secondLargest` with this new element.  
5. **Result:** The value in `secondLargest` is the answer. üëç

### Day 2: Move All Zeroes to End  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/move-all-zeroes-to-end-of-array0751)

A fun problem that reinforces the concept of array manipulation.  
**Problem:** Rearrange the array so that all zeroes are moved to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.  
**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Initialize** a pointer for the non-zero index.  
2. **Iterate** through the array.  
3. If a non-zero element is found:  
   - **Place:** it at the current non-zero index.  
4. After iteration, **fill** the remaining positions in the array with zeroes. üî¢

---  

### Day 3: Reverse An Array  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/reverse-an-array)

A classic problem whose solution is foundational for many other challenges.  
**Problem:** Reverse the order of elements in an array.  
**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Set:** two pointers: `i` at the start (0) and `j` at the end (last index).  
2. **Swap:** the elements at positions `i` and `j` using a temporary variable.  
3. **Increment:** `i` and **decrement:** `j` until they meet or cross.  
4. **Result:** The array is reversed. üîÑ

---  

### Day 4: Rotate Array  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/rotate-array-by-n-elements-1587115621)

A variation of the classic array rotation problem with a twist inspired by a LeetCode challenge.  
**Problem:** Rotate the array by a given number of positions using a modified approach.  
**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Implement:** Create a function that reverses a subarray from a specified start to end index.  
2. **Rotate:** Utilize the reverse array function with the following steps:  
   - Reverse the portion of the array to be rotated.  
   - Reverse the remaining portion.  
   - Reverse the entire array.  
3. **Note:** The order of operations is adjusted from the standard LeetCode approach (i.e., from steps 1, 2, 3 to 2, 3, 1) as per GFG requirements. üîÑ‚û°Ô∏è

---  

### Day 5: Next Permutation  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/next-permutation5226)

An easy optimal approach but difficulty in brute-force approach as it requires backtracking skills, whereas a better approach uses swapping.  
**Problem:** Calculate the next permutation of the given array.  
**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Loop:** Start from the second last index and move backwards to find the first element that is smaller than its next element.  
2. **Condition:** If such an element is not found, reverse the entire array.  
3. **Loop:** Otherwise, from the end of the array, find the first element that is greater than this identified element and swap them.  
4. **Finally:** Reverse the subarray following the swapped element's original position.  
5. **Result:** The array is updated to its next permutation.

---  

### Day 6: Majority Element II  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/majority-vote)

A problem that extends the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm (Majority-Element I).  
**Problem:** Find all elements in the array that appear more than ‚åän/3‚åã times.  
**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Initialize:**  
   - Two candidate variables `el1` and `el2` (e.g., set to `INT_MIN`).  
   - Two counters `count1` and `count2` set to 0.  
2. **Candidate Selection:**  
   - **Iterate** over the array:  
     - If the current element equals `el1`, increment `count1`.  
     - Else if it equals `el2`, increment `count2`.  
     - Else if `count1` is 0, set `el1` to the current element and `count1` to 1.  
     - Else if `count2` is 0, set `el2` to the current element and `count2` to 1.  
     - Else, decrement both `count1` and `count2`.  
3. **Validation:**  
   - Reset `count1` and `count2` to 0.  
   - **Iterate** over the array to count the occurrences of `el1` and `el2`.  
   - **Check:** If `count1` is greater than ‚åän/3‚åã, add `el1` to the result.  
   - **Check:** If `count2` is greater than ‚åän/3‚åã, add `el2` to the result.  
4. **Result:** Return the list of majority elements.

### Day 7: Stock Buy and Sell ‚Äì Multiple Transaction Allowed  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/stock-buy-and-sell2615)

This challenge focuses on maximizing profit by allowing multiple stock transactions. üìà  
**Problem:** Given an array of stock prices where the index represents the day, find the maximum profit that can be earned by making multiple buy-sell transactions.  
**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Initialize:**  
   - A variable `profit` to 0.  
2. **Iterate:**  
   - Loop through the array from day 1 to the last day.  
3. **Check:**  
   - For each day, if the price of the current day is greater than the previous day, it indicates an opportunity for profit.  
4. **Accumulate:**  
   - Add the difference (current day price minus previous day price) to `profit`.  
5. **Result:**  
   - The accumulated `profit` is the maximum profit obtainable. üí∞

---  

### Day 8: Stock Buy and Sell ‚Äì Max one Transaction Allowed  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/buy-stock-2/0)

A well-known optimization problem involving dynamic programming or a greedy approach.  
**Problem:** Given an array representing stock prices on each day, find the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling the stock **once**.  
**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Initialize:**  
   - A variable `minPrice` to store the minimum stock price seen so far (initially set to a very large value).  
   - A variable `maxProfit` to store the maximum profit (initially set to 0).  
2. **Iterate:**  
   - Loop through each day's stock price.  
3. **Check:**  
   - If the current price is less than `minPrice`, update `minPrice`.  
   - Else, calculate profit = current price - `minPrice`, and update `maxProfit` if this profit is greater.  
4. **Result:**  
   - The value in `maxProfit` is the maximum profit achievable with one transaction. üìä

### Day 9: Minimize the Heights II  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/minimize-the-heights3351)

A greedy-style problem involving height adjustments.  
**Problem:** Given an array representing tower heights and a value `k`, modify each height by either increasing or decreasing it by `k` and find the minimum difference between the tallest and shortest towers after modification.  
**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Sort** the array to get a baseline for heights.  
2. **Initialize:**  
   - `minHeight` and `maxHeight` to hold possible extremes after modifications.  
   - `ans` to hold the initial height difference (i.e., `arr[n - 1] - arr[0]`).  
3. **Iterate** from index 1 to n-1:  
   - Skip if subtracting `k` results in negative height.  
   - Calculate new `minHeight = min(arr[0] + k, arr[i] - k)`  
   - Calculate new `maxHeight = max(arr[i - 1] + k, arr[n - 1] - k)`  
   - Update `ans` with the minimum of current `ans` and `maxHeight - minHeight`  
4. **Return:** Final minimized height difference.

### Day 10: Kadane's Algorithm  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/kadanes-algorithm-1587115620)

A classic dynamic programming challenge used to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum. üí°  
**Problem:**  
Find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum.

**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Initialize:**  
   - `max_sum` with the value of the first element.  
   - `currentMax` with the value of the first element.  
2. **Iterate:**  
   - For every element from the second element onward:  
     - Update `currentMax = max(current element, currentMax + current element)` ‚ö°  
     - Update `maxSoFar = max(max_sum, currentMax)` üî•  
3. **Result:**  
   - Return `max_sum` as the maximum subarray sum.

### Day 11: Maximum Product Subarray  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/maximum-product-subarray3604)

A challenging variation of the maximum subarray sum, where we find the subarray with the **maximum product** instead.  
**Problem:**  
Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Initialize:**  
   - `prefixProduct` and `suffixProduct` to 1.  
   - `maxProduct` to `INT_MIN`.  
   - `n` as the size of the array.  
2. **Iterate:**  
   - From `i = 0` to `n-1`:  
     - Multiply `prefixProduct` with `arr[i]`  
     - Multiply `suffixProduct` with `arr[n-i-1]`  
     - Update `maxProduct = max(maxProduct, max(prefixProduct, suffixProduct))`  
     - If `prefixProduct == 0`, reset to 1  
     - If `suffixProduct == 0`, reset to 1  
3. **Result:**  
   - Return `maxProduct` as the maximum product subarray.

### Day 12: Max Circular Subarray Sum  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/max-circular-subarray-sum-1587115620)

A twist on the classic maximum subarray problem where the array is considered circular. üîÑ  
**Problem:**  
Find the maximum subarray sum in a circular array.

**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Compute the total sum** of the array.  
2. **Find the maximum subarray sum** using Kadane's algorithm.  
3. **Find the minimum subarray sum** using a modified version of Kadane's algorithm.  
4. **Determine the result:**  
   - If the total sum equals the minimum subarray sum (i.e., all elements are negative), return the maximum subarray sum.  
   - Otherwise, return the greater value between the normal maximum subarray sum and `(total sum - minimum subarray sum)`. üí•üéâ

### Day 13: Smallest Positive Missing Number  
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/arrays-gfg-160/problem/smallest-positive-missing-number-1587115621)

A problem to find the smallest positive missing number in an array.  
**Problem:**  
Identify the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array.

**Approach (PseudoCode):**  
1. **Sort** the array to arrange all elements in ascending order.  
2. **Initialize** a variable (say, `x`) to `1`.  
3. **Iterate** over the sorted array:  
   - If the current element equals `x`, increment `x`.  
   - If an element greater than `x` is encountered, break the loop since `x` is missing.  
4. **Result:**  
   - The value of `x` at the end of the loop is the smallest positive missing number. üöÄ
